Solutions for questions in Book "Cracking the coding Interview"

Self Review
1.	Strength
Tenacity &Drive:
Among all of the 9 characteristics, I believe Tenacity & Drive is the best to describe who I am. I am kind a perfectionist, so I never just want to get things done, but done perfectly, in terms of both quality and efficiency. In order to do that, I always love to have a clear goal first and understand why we are doing that. But I don’t just take in what I was told, just also think actively whether we can do better (e.g. the topology design, data indexing structure, etc), even if it might be in consistent with some original designs. When coding, besides implementing actual functions, I would also consider a lot about the design, about possible problems and uncertainty in the future. I also have a strong urgency to accomplish goals, as I love to leave more time to be prepared rather than being surprised by lots of unanticipated problems. Therefore, I am always quite pushy on the schedule during the meetings, for both team and group projects. 

I believe Intellectual Curiosity also fits me well. I am writing Java programs for the team project, which I have no much previous experience, let alone those frameworks. I saw the ways how other projects work, which I can try to mimic. But I would rather to understand them in a systematically way. So I spent around 4 hours to learn Spring and Junit online by myself and managed to use those technics effectively into my program. One of my experienced team member even asked me to teach him some new usage of the annotations after looking into my code. (clear mind)

I also focused a lot on teamwork. For each task, I would fully discuss with my team member to ensure our understandings are the same and all agreed on the decisions we made. Every time I figured out something or solved some problems that I think the others might need, I kept the solution and explanation well-documented on confluence pages. I am also willing to take on more responsibilities. For example, when I noticed that my team member didn’t have enough time to finish her tasks, I volunteered to take on. 


2.	Improvement
Judgment
Communication
Diversity & Inclusion:

I think the first area I need to improve on is my communication. At beginning, I don’t really love to communicate with people face to face or through phones, but rather preferring through emails. The reason is because I believed that emails can give me more time to consider how to respond properly, rather than saying some silly things during the talking. But then I realized that this is not the style of how this firm works, and I do starts to feel the advantage from talking to people directly, like the efficiency and more information that emails can hardly delivery (e.g. emotions). So, I started trying to talk to people more directly, starting from meeting more people, like joining the networks. Another related problem is that I was not really brave to ask people questions. One main reason is that I really don’t want to interrupt or bother other people, as I will feel so sorry for that. But goldman sachs has amazed me by how the people here love to share. I can set up meeting with anyone, and they all are willing to talk to you. I also got lots of response to my questions in some sythponey rooms. Due to the positive feedback, I am now more and more love to ask people questions and even feels excited by answering others’ questions. 
Another area I need to improve on is Diversity & Inclusion, as I feel myself tend to be around people who has similar background as me, like prefer to talk to interns than seniors, Chinese than foreigners, etc. But I am starting to aware that I actually can learn much more from people who has different backgrounds from you. Therefore, I am pushing myself out of the comfortable zone to talk to more people, like joining LGBT network, and meet with people from other teams. 
I also want to improve on my judgement. Since during my team project, there was several times that I felt I am able to identify all the cons and pros of each options we have on some problems, but hard to make a judgement of which to choose. Sometimes it’s due to the lack of experience as there is usually no perfect choice. What I am trying to do is to provide my analyzes and see how my experienced team members choose and understand why, so that I am able to judge better next time.
